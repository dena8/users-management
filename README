This is a Spring RESTful application with a PostgreSQL database, developed using the MVC design pattern. Before running the application, you need to ensure that PostgreSQL is installed either locally or in a Docker container. Here are the steps to set up the database:
1. Run the following command to start a PostgreSQL Docker container:
  docker run --name <container-name> -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<password> -p <host-port>:5432 -v <host-path>:/var/lib/postgresql/data -d postgres:alpine
  This command will start a PostgreSQL container with the specified settings, including data persistence.
2. Access the container's shell by executing the following command:
  docker exec -it <container-name> bash
3. Once inside the container's shell, run the following command to access the PostgreSQL command-line interface (CLI):
  psql -U postgres
This command opens the PostgreSQL CLI as the default postgres user.
4. Within the PostgreSQL CLI, create the database by executing the following command:
  CREATE DATABASE users_db;
After completing these steps, the PostgreSQL database is set up and ready to be used by Spring application.
